Analyze the frontend code of the current project in depth. Identify and extract **as many guidelines as possible** based on recurring patterns, conventions, and implicit practices observed in the codebase. Include even partial or informal patterns if they appear consistently.

Focus your analysis on the following areas:

- Component structure and composition (file organization, folder hierarchy, atomic design principles, etc.)
- State management (local vs. global, libraries used, separation of concerns)
- Props and data flow (typing, destructuring, default values, immutability)
- UI consistency (reusable components, design tokens, layout strategies, theming)

Then, analyze the frontend testing code (unit, integration, and e2e) with equal attention. Derive a **rich and detailed set of guidelines** based on repeated testing practices.

Focus on:

- Test structure and file placement
- Naming and grouping of tests (describe blocks, titles, hierarchy)
- Assertion patterns and style
- Mocking/stubbing strategies (e.g. services, APIs, local storage)
- Test clarity and expressiveness (what is being tested and why)
- Usage of testing libraries and setup utilities (e.g. render helpers, test wrappers)

Return **a list of concise, specific, and actionable guidelines** for frontend implementation and frontend testing.
